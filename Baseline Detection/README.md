This pipeline is there to illustrate an example on how the spectrogram looks  like for different technologies. The sampling rate is set to 300MHz. It has to be set to 61.44MHz, and accordingly the center frequencies, and bandwidth has to be changed in the code.





The WLAN is generated from wlanNonHTConfig toolbox, LTE from lteRMCDL toolbox, NR from NR toolbox and RADAR from PAST toolbox in MATLAB.





Please run the main script generate\_spectrumSensingBaseline.m to get the template outputs
