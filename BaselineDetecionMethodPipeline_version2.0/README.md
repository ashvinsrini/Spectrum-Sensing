The original simulations was done for 2000 images and SNR ranges ranging in  \[0,5,10,15,20] dB, for sampling rate of 61.44MHz, and 40 ms sub frame. In the baseline code that is uploaded, the sampling freq has been set to 300MHz and for a fixed SNR, and that has to be changed along with spectrogram frames which is now set to 180 has to be changed to 2000.

 





Please run the main script genDataset180\_and\_baseline.m to get the template outputs
